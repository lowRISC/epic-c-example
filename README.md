# RISC-V Embedded PIC Demo

## Overview

lowRISC is working on a [specification](https://github.com/luismarques/epic-spec) and [prototype toolchain implementation](https://github.com/lowRISC/llvm-project/commits/epic) of an Embedded PIC (ePIC) ABI for RISC-V.

This repository showcases how to use the work-in-progress ePIC toolchain implementation. It contains an example of how to create fully relocatable RISC-V apps that require only a simple runtime loader. To demonstrate the relocatability, the repository also contains a simple kernel that loads and relocates the example app.

- The kernel has its entry point in `kernel.c`.
- The current example loadable app is CoreMark.

The example runs in spike (riscv-isa-sim) and simulates a system with both SRAM and Flash memory. The kernel image embeds the ELF files it will load at arbitrary addresses during system execution. The steps to load an app are:

- First the kernel simulates programming the Flash memory with the contents of the app that would be programmed into Flash in an actual embedded system.
- Then a relocating loader, adapted from libtock-c crt0, loads the app from the simulated Flash into the simulated SRAM and relocates it. The relocation process applies simple relocations (`R_RISCV_32` or `R_RISCV_64`) to the data segment, updating statically initialized pointers, vtables, and similar.
- The GP register (the PIC base) is set to point to the app's SRAM base address.
- Control is transferred to the just-loaded app and it starts running.

## Building and Running

Build requirements:

- spike (riscv-isa-sim)
- xxd
- LLVM build dependencies

The dependencies may be built and installed manually or the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) can be used to set up a container with the dependencies pre-installed.

Use `make` to build and run everything.

The Clang/LLVM toolchain with ePIC support is automatically built as part of this example.
